What is this? 

This project started off as a Brute Force Login Attempter. However, I intially had a lot of trouble getting it to work, over the course of several days it really changed ideas. Now I have settled on a Reddit WebScraper and Social Media Uploader. I plan on really expanding this project, many emcompassing several different websites. It also creates a new working directory and changes into that directory so all the images are stored in there. I also plan on finding a way to wipe those images after the program is done to get rid off them. As of right now in it's published state it has to be modified to login ones' tumblr account. 

Why is this useful?

I wanted to get a feel for using more Python tools, I stumbled across Selenium and instantly was hooked. I realized far too late that there exists a tumblr API, so to make the project a little harder, I wanted to see if it was possible if I could work around not having an API and just use Selenium to download and upload photos directly. It took a lot of work to navagiate and inspect a lot of elements, eventually however I got everything to work.
