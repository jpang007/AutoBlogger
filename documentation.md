What is this? 

This project started off as a Brute Force Login Attempter. However, I intially had a lot of trouble getting it to work, over the course of several days it really changed ideas. Now I have settled on a Reddit WebScraper and Social Media Uploader. I plan on really expanding this project, many emcompassing several different websites. It also creates a new working directory and changes into that directory so all the images are stored in there. I also plan on finding a way to wipe those images after the program is done to get rid off them.
